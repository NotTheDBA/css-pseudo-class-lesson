### Bonus Tip:

This is a note that it's always a good idea to go back over your code after you have gotten to a final solution.  Often when we are developing, we are trying many things - they may work part of the way, but end up being useless in our final solution.  Becuase they were never "broken", it's easy to skip over the fact that they don't actually do anything for our code!

Compare these these files I created working out the solution with their final clean versions included in the lesson examples:

* [solved html][sample.html] vs [final html][../ex7/sample.html]

* [solved css][sample.css] vs [final css][../ex7/sample.css]
