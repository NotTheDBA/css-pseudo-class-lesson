# CSS Pseudo Class Selectors
### HTML and CSS

This lesson will introduce the concept of CSS pseudo class selectors by demonstrating the use of the following example selectors to style and control display of content on a page:

* `:focus`
* `:focus-within`
* `:hover`
* `:not`

The material will be presented as a lecture and demonstration, with opportunities for questions.  It assumes prior instruction in HTML and CSS, and a good understanding of the use of basic CSS selector classes.

####Next:

The following lesson should cover presence attribute selectors – `[attr]` –  and value attribute selectors `[attr=val]` in similar detail.
